# Data Professional Survey Breakdown Dashboard

This project showcases my expertise in data analysis and visualization using Power BI, focusing on dissecting and visualizing data from a survey of data professionals. Leveraging the Power Query capabilities in Power BI, I cleaned and transformed the raw survey data to extract meaningful insights. The resulting dashboard provides a comprehensive breakdown of survey responses, enabling users to make informed decisions based on key metrics.

## Project Objectives:

The primary objectives of this project were to:

1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - Utilize Power Query in Power BI to clean and prepare the raw survey data for analysis.
   - Standardize and structure the data to ensure consistency and accuracy in subsequent analysis.

2. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Develop a user-friendly dashboard in Power BI to visualize survey insights effectively.
   - Incorporate interactive features and intuitive design elements to enhance user experience.

3. **Key Metrics Analysis**:
   - Analyze various survey parameters to extract actionable insights, including:
     - Country distribution of survey takers.
     - Favorite programming languages among data professionals.
     - Average salary by job title.
     - Difficulty of breaking into the data field.
     - Happiness with work/life balance and salary.
     - Total number of survey takers and average age.

## Dashboard Highlights:

- **Country Distribution**: Visual representation of the geographic distribution of survey participants, providing insights into the global reach of the survey.
  
- **Programming Language Preferences**: Bar chart displaying the popularity of different programming languages among data professionals, aiding in technology stack analysis and hiring decisions.

- **Salary Analysis**: Interactive visualization of average salaries across different job titles, enabling salary benchmarking and negotiation strategies.

- **Career Challenges and Satisfaction**: Gauge the perceived difficulty of entering the data field and assess satisfaction levels regarding work/life balance and salary, crucial for talent retention and organizational improvement initiatives.
